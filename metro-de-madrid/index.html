                It was fun taking different approaches to responsive design!

                Using Vanilla CSS, a problem I usually ran into was the overflow of a div or text element (headings or paragraphs) in its parent container. I wanted to make the width and height of certain elements responsive without changing them at fixed breakpoints, since doing so can give off a "blockish change" rather than a gradual one. Moreover, relying on relative units for sizing can be flawed in certain cases (element has too much whitespace on a small screen or too little whitespace on a large screen). Because of these reasons, I relied on clamp. I wasn't too familiar with the function, so it became a trial and error process that sometimes resulted in overflow.

                Bootstrap definitely makes responsive design easier since it provides a lot of structure. Being able to use CSS utilities (breakpoints, flexbox behaviours, etc) by defining class names to an HTML element is convenient. It was just frustrating to use since I wasn't familiar with the framework as a whole. When I thought I understood certain fundamentals, things weren't displaying in the way I wanted them to. This usually occurred when I defined elements with a container class with a specified breakpoint. Though I prefer vanilla CSS for the creative freedom it gives me, I do like the breakpoint options given to Bootstrap containers.
